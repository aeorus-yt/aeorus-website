      Impacts of Technology
    </h3>
    <p class="text textcenter">
      Technology has made a massive impact on society. Everyone nowadays uses some sort of technology for almost any purpose.
      Most objects you see have been made by technology. Technology is everywhere, ubiquitous and seen by all people.
      These pieces of technology have changed our lives drastically, and have been really helpful to all of us.
      However, technology isnt all beneficial to us.

          <p class="desctext">
            The benefits to technology are the massive amounts of innovation that we've done over the past 50 years.
            <br>
            <br>We are now able to more accurately diagnose diseases and give more effective treatment that has worked on millions of patients, potentially saving billions of lives.
            AI-enhanced treatments are currently treating millions of people around the world with more accurate treatments than ever, progressing health and science to another level.
            Over the course of 100 years, technology went from trying to find out how to stop epidemics to creating vaccines for the majority of deadly viruses, and greately improving the average lifespan from 60 to 80 years.
            <br>
            <br>Health isn't the only thing that's improved recently, as public systems are more accessable due to blockchain technology (the same stuff that makes your crypto currency work!)
            These public systems are decentralized and are less impacted by politics or a centralized third party.
            This makes for a more robust system that works even when something really bad happens, which would have been unheard of 100 years ago.
            Back then, public systems were a lot less robust and votes would be easier to fake. However, votes are a lot harder to fake nowadays.
            <br>
            <br>Manufacturing processes have greately improved due to the impact of Technology as well.
            Manufacturing has gotten a lot more efficient as time goes on, with 3D printing enabling anyone to create whatever they want with plastic nowadays.
            Back in the 1900's, manufacturing was a lot more basic and robots couldn't do as much as nowadays.
            Robots are now capable of manufacturing the device you use to read this article.
            <br>
            <br>Social media has increased our interconnectivity across the world, and we're able to talk to anyone at any distance.
            Websites and apps like Instagram, Discord and Snapchat allow people to communicate across the world in ways that were unheard of back in the 1900's.

          <h2>Consequences</h2>
        </button>
        <div class="content" style="height:350px;">
          <p class="desctext">
            Manufacturing has also removed a lot of jobs, as robots are taking everything over.
            This is a big consequence as people need work to sustain their families, and technology is taking that away from people.
            Creativity in manufacturing has also significantly decreased, as things become more standardised
            <br>
            <br>Social Media has also destoryed most of Gen Z and Gen Alpha.
            Gen Z and Millenials tend to spend around 5 hours and 30 minutes on social media, while older generations haven't been as affected and only use social media for 3-4 hours a day.
            Analytics for Gen Alpha aren't available, but it's clearly evident that social media has taken over society, and caused plenty of problems with screentime.
            <br>
            <br>The other issue with social media is the data allegations that these companies are facing.
            Meta, also known as facebook, has been accused of stealing all of our data, while TikTok has been outright banned in government phones due to allegations that TikTok sells your data to the CCP.
            These are just allegations, but are also important to note as the apps that you depend on a daily basis could betray you.
            <br>
            <br>AI could pose plenty of problems, specifically with unemployment.
            AI could take most creative jobs if it's developed further, with plenty of jobs becoming obselete by the year 2050.
            AI art is on the craze, which could put professional artists out of a job, and AI could put data analysists out of a job as well, due to the AI compiling the data for you into a nice chart.
